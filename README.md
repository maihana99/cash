A program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:

Change owed: 25
1

But prompts the user for an int greater than 0, so that the program works for any amount of change:

Change owed: 70
4

Re-prompts the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than or equal to 0 (or if their input isn’t an int at all!).
